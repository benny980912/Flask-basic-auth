### Get Started
1. We are going to create a virtual environment using venv. Python now ships with a pre-installed venv library. 
- `python -m venv env`

2. Now, we need to activate the environment using this command:
- `source env/bin/activate`

3. To install the above-mentioned libraries:
- `pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-Bcrypt Flask-WTF FLask-Migrate Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Testing python-decouple`

4. To initialize the database (create a migration repository), use the command:
`flask db init`

5. To migrate the database changes, use the command:
`flask db migrate`

6. To apply the migrations, use the command:
`flask db upgrade`

7. To run your application using the command:
`python manage.py run`

8. you can run all the tests using the command:
`python manage.py test`

9. To create an Admin user:
`python manage.py create_admin`
